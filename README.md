This is a simple program that generates the sounds "Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si" in the C major scale. The output is a `.wav` file. The program works by creating sine waves based on the frequencies of the notes and then converting them into a valid `.wav` file. 

> [!TIP]
> You can see all sounds generated in the [`out`](out/) directory
